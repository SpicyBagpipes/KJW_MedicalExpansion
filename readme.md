# Core

The Core module aims to provide frameworks that the other mods can build off of, as well as a baseline of realistic features that do not necessarily require use of other Medical Expansion mods to gain benefits from. The feature set is as follows.
* Blood Data - Red & White blood cells as well as platelets.
* Cannulation Framework - Configurable cannulae with line occupation.
* Symptoms Framework - Symptoms of diseases or other illnesses.
* Centrifuge - Examine blood samples and view their properties for verifying disease diagnoses.
* Blood Types - Synchronised with KAM Blood Types, with an option for incompatibility.
* Leave Body Respawn - Allow your medics to continue working on you after your respawn.
    * TODO: Comas - Ensure the AI controlling your previous body do not wake up.
* PPE - Used by other Medical Expansion mods and has the ability to be used by extended mods.
