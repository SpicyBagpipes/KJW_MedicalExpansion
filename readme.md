# KJW's Medical Expansion

KJW's Medical Expansion is a set of mods which aim to expand the existing ACE medical system in order to add a variety of engaging, interesting and realistic features. A higher level of fidelity will be achieved when the mod is ran with [KAT - Advanced Medical](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2020940806), and will expand on features that they add. The current module set is found below, with this repository being used for Core.
    - KJW's Medical Expansion: Core
    - KJW's Medical Expansion: Radiate
    - KJW's Medical Expansion: Diseases
    - KJW's Medical Expansion: Toxins

# Core

The Core module aims to provide frameworks that the other mods can build off of, as well as a baseline of realistic features that do not necessarily require use of other Medical Expansion mods to gain benefits from. The feature set is as follows.
    - Blood Data - Red & White blood cells as well as platelets.
    - Cannulation Framework - Configurable cannulae with line occupation.
    - Symptoms Framework - Symptoms of diseases or other illnesses.
    - Centrifuge - Examine blood samples and view their properties for verifying disease diagnoses.
    - Blood Types - Synchronised with KAM Blood Types, with an option for incompatibility.
    - Leave Body Respawn - Allow your medics to continue working on you after your respawn.
        - Comas - Ensure the AI controlling your previous body do not wake up.
    - PPE - Used by other Medical Expansion mods and has the ability to be used by extended mods.
