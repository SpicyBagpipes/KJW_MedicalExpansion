# Radiation Poisoning

Radiation poisoning can be caused through two methods. One is an exposure to more than 5 ionising power units per second, which will cause random rolls for radiation poisoning. The other method is a random roll that happens when the unit has over 500 ionising power units in total. Both of these trigger the `KJW_Radiate_Core_damaged` CBA event locally to the unit.
