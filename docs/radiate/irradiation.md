# Irradiation

Irradiation can occur when the unit is in a dust zone. Particles are intentionally left out so that you are able to do your own.

The mod has two types of irradiation; **inhaled** and **contact**. These will turn the player into a radioactive source to a degree, with ways to reverse these (despite one being rather gamified). The differences between the two are follows:\
**Inhaled:**\
\- If the respirator allows some dust through, it will be inhaled. It is removed from the body by administering EDTA.\
\- This irradiation cannot be removed by a decontamination shower.\
**Contact:**\
\- Dust will eventually settle on the unit's skin, regardless of the suit they use.\
\- This irradiation can be removed by a decontamination shower.
