# Medications

Medications require an IV for usage, with EACA being compatible with KAM's EACA (though has none of the other features KAM's does -- administer KAM EACA instead if using KAM).\
\
EACA will reduce the total ionisation by the coefficient set in addon options every second while the medication is present in the system. This is not easily tracked, and the best way to do so is to administer blood and take a blood sample.\
\
EDTA will do the same as the above but for the inhaled radiation. This is best tracked with a geiger counter.
