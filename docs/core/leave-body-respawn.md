# Leave Body Respawn

The base ACE Medical unconsciousness is not particularly fun for the patient, and players will often just respawn if they are unconscious for long enough. This detracts from the enjoyability of the medics, and as such is not ideal in ensuring gameplay is fun as possible for both parties.

ME:C aims to rectify this by providing the Leave Body Respawn system, which is toggleable in addon options. This will cause the respawn button when unconscious to create a new unit and place the player's control in that unit, which will cause AI to take over control of the player's previous body. This new unit is then instantly killed, meaning the player gets to respawn whilst leaving their previous body behind with AI control, meaning ACE Medical features will continue to work as intended. This provides both parties the maximum enjoyability, with the newly respawned player able to man a medevac to extract their previous body, be reinserted or otherwise.
