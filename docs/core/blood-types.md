# Blood Types

As with the real world, units in ME:C have blood types. Type rejection is able to be disabled, as well as preference to KAM or ME:C blood type can be set if KAM is loaded. By default, blood bags taken from the arsenal have the "ideal"  statistics; they have no chance of rejection from the recipient's body, and have 100% Red Blood Cell, White Blood Cell and Platelet counts, along with having no diseases carried.

Blood Types are assigned either by the unit's Steam ID (with random number generation weighted to real world distributions of Blood Types) or by the same aforementioned random number generation if the unit is AI, or in singleplayer. Note that the blood type is saved to the unit's profile once they join **any** multiplayer server, and such will be static across multiplayer and singleplayer games after a multiplayer session has been joined.

Blood Types must be properly compatible when giving a blood transfusion to a unit. The blood type can be checked by opening the inventory, double clicking the blood bag and selecting the "Inspect" button. This will show the sticker present on the blood bag, which has the blood type. This sticker is also displayed when the transfusion begins.\
Symptoms of blood rejection include:\
\- Blood loss (haemolysis)\
\- Bruising\
\- If KAM is loaded, the KAM blood incompatibility will be triggered instead\
\
If a unit is given the incorrect blood, the IV may be withdrawn at any time during the transfusion to stop the blood being incorrectly transfused. Note this will destroy the blood bag.
