# Symptoms

Whilst it is not utilised just yet, the symptoms system is scripted and complete (just need to add more). Variables are 0-1 and are set on the **unit** directly, **not** the blood data. They are currently as follows:\
\- `KJW_MedicalExpansion_Symptoms_Cough`\
\- `KJW_MedicalExpansion_Symptoms_Sneeze`\
\- `KJW_MedicalExpansion_Symptoms_Sniff`
