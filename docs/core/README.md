# Core

Medical Expansion: Core serves as the central place for the mod. It provides a feature set of its own right, and as with all Medical Expansion mods, maintains compatibility with KAT: Advanced Medical in addition to the regular ACE Medical for Arma 3, and in the case of Core, adds features exclusive to when KAT:AM (KAM) is loaded.\
\
Core is able to be run completely standalone from the rest of the Medical Expansion and add a small level of detail to the base ACE Medical system; IV lines, Blood Data and such.\
\
The core also adds patches to ACE Arsenal Extended for USP uniforms, adding "MED" and blood group patches, all in black and multicam. No further variants will be provided in the interest of bloat.
