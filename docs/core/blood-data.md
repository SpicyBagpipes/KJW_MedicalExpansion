# Blood Data

Whilst it does next to nothing without KAM being loaded, the flagship feature of ME:Core is the Blood Data system. This allows for players to have properties about their blood change and have it carry across IV transfusions when blood has been drawn, along with providing easy persistence for symptoms of diseases and other conditions that are bloodborne.\
\
With KAM loaded, the Blood Data will do the following without any further ME mods loaded:\
\- If the unit's Red Blood Cell count becomes too low, the unit's SpO2 (Blood Oxygen) will begin to drop. This will be moved to regular ACE Medical in the next ACE update.\
\- If the unit's Platelet count becomes too low, the unit's clotting factor will begin to drop, which will prevent any wounds from clotting until the platelets are replenished via IV transfusion.
