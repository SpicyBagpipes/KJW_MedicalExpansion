KJW's Medical Expansion is a set of Arma 3 modifications which aim to provide a more in depth and grounded world within the confines of the Armaverse, whilst still providing a gameified and unique experience for all players.



Medical Expansion will eventually comprise of the following mods:\
\- Medical Expansion: Core\
\- Radiate\
\- Diseases\
\- Toxins\
\- ???\
\
Each of these mods have a unique collection of pages detailing their features, with a core page for each in order to convey the intent behind each of these mods.

**A word from the author**\
Hello! Thank you for taking interest in KJW's Medical Expansion. The Core mod alone is a culmination of 6 months of scripting, researching and designing almost exclusively by me alone, where I have had to find and ask professionals about information that is not often readily accessible on the internet.\

In real life, I am a Physics student in the UK, and as such Radiate is (probably quite clearly on this documentation) the modification I am most passionate about. My aim with this mod was not only to provide a more interesting experience within Arma, but also to encourage people to research these topics themselves when extending their functionality, as there is a lot of interesting things to discover and get your teeth into (for example, I discovered you actually (effectively) _lose_ blood when getting an incorrect blood type transfusion!). I hope you enjoy playing with this set of mods!
